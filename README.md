## Predicting Patient Readmission Risk Within 30 Days

## Project Overview
This project builds an AI-driven solution to predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. The system assists healthcare providers in early intervention, improves patient outcomes, and optimizes resource use.

## Objectives
Predict 30-day readmission risk using EHR and demographic data.

Reduce preventable readmissions and associated penalties.

Provide actionable insights to clinical staff for better patient follow-up.

## Stakeholders
Healthcare Providers: Doctors, nurses, and care coordinators using predictions for planning.

Hospital Administrators: Ensure regulatory compliance and optimize operations.

## Problem Scope
Problem: Anticipate readmission within 30 days post-discharge.

KPI: F1-score to balance false positives/negatives.

## Data Strategy
Data Sources
Electronic Health Records (EHR): Diagnoses, medications, discharge notes, lab results.

Demographic Data: Age, gender, insurance type, location.

Patient History: Previous visits, chronic conditions.

## Ethical Concerns
Privacy & HIPAA Compliance: Sensitive data must be securely handled and anonymized.

Bias: Historical inequities may cause unfair predictions for vulnerable groups.

## Preprocessing Pipeline
Handle missing values (imputation).

One-hot encode categorical variables.

Feature engineering: chronic illness flags, discharge type, prior admissions.

Normalize continuous features like age and lab values.

## Model Development
## Chosen Model
XGBoost (Gradient Boosting) â€” Offers high accuracy, handles imbalanced datasets, and provides feature importance.

## Evaluation Metrics (Hypothetical Data)

## Deployment Strategy
Export model as an API (Flask/FastAPI).

Integrate with hospital EHR via FHIR API.

Trigger predictions on discharge; display risk score in clinical dashboard.

## Compliance & Security
Follow HIPAA guidelines: encryption, RBAC, audit logging.

Conduct data protection impact assessments.

Maintain data and model versioning with secure access.

## Optimization
Overfitting Prevention: Use k-fold cross-validation and early stopping during training.

Track training/validation loss curves to tune depth and learning rate.

## Ethics & Bias

## Interpretability vs Accuracy
In clinical use, explainable models (e.g., SHAP values in XGBoost) are preferred over black-box models.

Trade-offs managed using interpretable ML frameworks that retain strong performance.

## Reflection

Most Challenging Part:

Future Improvements:
Involve clinicians in model feedback loops.
Collect more representative data.
Automate fairness monitoring and reporting in real-time.
